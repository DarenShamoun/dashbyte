Dashbyte
Dashbyte is a web application that provides a variety of services, including software development, PC building, IT services, and website design. The application is built using React and Bootstrap for the front-end and connects to OpenAI's GPT-3 model for chat functionality.

Features
Home Page: The home page features a full-scale chat interface where users can interact with an AI model. The chat interface is built using React and Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly experience.

Services Page: The services page provides information about the various services offered by Dashbyte. Each service is presented in a card-like format for easy reading.

Chat Interface: The chat interface is available on all pages of the application. On the home page, the chat interface is full-scale, while on other pages, it appears as a small, floating chat box. The chat interface maintains message and context consistency across all pages.

AI Integration: The chat interface connects to OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide intelligent and interactive responses to user inputs. The AI integration is handled on the server-side, with the client-side code making POST requests to the server to process user inputs.

Goals
The primary goal of Dashbyte is to provide a seamless and interactive user experience. The chat interface is designed to be intuitive and engaging, with the AI providing intelligent responses to user inputs. The application aims to maintain a consistent chat context across all pages, allowing users to continue their conversation with the AI as they navigate through the site.

Future Improvements
Future improvements to Dashbyte may include further refining the chat interface and expanding the range of services offered. The application may also benefit from additional AI integrations, such as more advanced natural language processing capabilities.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
